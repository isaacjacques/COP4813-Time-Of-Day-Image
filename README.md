# Assignment 3: Time-Based Image Display Webpage

## 1. Introduction

The objective of this assignment is to build a simple webpage that changes the image it displays based on the current time of day. Students will implement time-aware functionality using HTML and JavaScript and host the webpage on a free web hosting platform. The final deliverable will include the deployed webpage URL, source code, and documentation explaining how the system works.

## 2. Objectives

- Build a webpage using HTML and JavaScript
- Display different images depending on the time of day
- Deploy the webpage to a publicly accessible hosting service
- Explain how the logic was implemented and any assumptions made

## 3. System Requirements

### 3.1 Technologies to be Used

- **HTML** and **JavaScript**
- **Hosting**: Any free web hosting service (e.g., Github Pages, InfinityFree, 000webhost)  

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Webpage Content

Create a file called index.html with the following content:
- First and last name
- Course name
- Your major
- A brief introduction message (e.g., "Welcome to my dynamic webpage!")
A single image container that changes based on the user's local time:
- Morning (6am to 12pm): Show a morning image (e.g., sunrise)
- Afternoon (12pm to 6pm): Show an afternoon image (e.g., sunshine or daytime activity)
- Evening/Night (6pm to 6am): Show a night image (e.g., moon or city lights)
You may use local images or link to royalty-free images hosted online (e.g., Unsplash or Pixabay). Make sure your images are visually distinct and appropriate for the time of day.

### 4.2 Deployment

- Deploy your webpage using GitHub Pages, 000WebHost, InfinityFree, or another free web hosting provider. 
- Ensure your site is accessible from mobile and desktop browsers.

### 4.3 Output

- A functioning HTML webpage that switches between three images based on the current time
- A working public URL

## 5. Deployment Instructions

- Select a free hosting provider
- Upload and deploy your webpage
- Test that the image updates correctly across different time ranges (use your browsers dev tools or manually adjust the system clock to simulate time of day)

## 6. Submission Guidelines
### 6.1 Deliverables

1. **Public URL** to the hosted login system.  
2. A compressed **ZIP file** containing:  
   - A short overview of system functionality
   - Any known issues or assumptions
   - All source code files (index.html, image files if used, etc.)

### 6.2 Submission Format
- Upload the ZIP file to canvas
